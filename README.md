# Center for Environmental Studies: Unit By-Laws

*Adopted 27 September 2019*

These Bylaws describe the procedures by which the Center for Environmental Studies (CES) in VCU Life Sciences (VCULS) at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) self-governs. Through the structure and processes outlined in these Bylaws, CES encourages faculty, post-doctoral fellows, academic and research professionals, and students to seek a productive balance between education, research, and service. These Bylaws are binding upon current and future administrative officers and members of this academic unit. These bylaws apply to all members of VCU Life Sciences (VCULS), including tenured/tenure-eligible, non-tenure-track individuals and staff.

## Statement of Shared Governance

These Bylaws follow the Virginia Commonwealth University: [University Council Philosophy of Shared Governance](https://president.vcu.edu/media/president/assets/pdfs/Univ_Council_Philosophy_of_Shared_Governance_Approved_May_4_2017.pdf). These Bylaws are based on the principle of shared governance. It is the responsibility of the CES administration to communicate freely, frankly, and in a timely fashion with all members on decisions affecting the mission and operations of the unit. These decisions include—but are not limited to—approval of changes to academic programs and curriculum, budgetary planning, strategic planning, and the development and organization of personnel. It is the responsibility of all faculty and staff to promote a positive environment of communication and involvement in these unit decisions.

This document is in accordance with Article VI of the Bylaws of the Faculty with respect to shared governance.

## Article I. Mission

The CES is a VCU Charter Center dedicated to geospatial and environmental research, education, and service. The CES is unique in that it has been given a dual mission as both a Board of Visitors Chartered Research Center and a unit that maintains undergraduate and graduate curricula approved by the State Council of Higher Education of Virginia (SCHEV). As a research center, our mission is to conduct research, perform services, and produce practitioners of evidence-based science as it relates to the interaction of life, earth, and policy sciences. The Center also provides courses, certificates, and degree programs that enable students throughout the University to explore and fulfill the science requirement of their degrees, thereby providing them with a solid foundation in the environmental sciences. The undergraduate and graduate programs in environmental studies are interdisciplinary in nature, exposing students to the critical links between the areas of environmental science and policy.

## Section 2.3. Membership

The operation of the Center requires the effort of both Professional Staff and Academic Faculty.  

### Professional Staff

Professional staff shall be recruited to support the mission of the Center. Individual staff members will report to and be evaluated by the Director unless otherwise specified.

### Academic Faculty
A broad range of academic professionals are necessary for the operation of the Center. Academic faculty are defined as individuals who directly contribute to either the research or curriculum of the Center and are categorized as either Affiliate, Adjunct, Term, or Tenure Track.

#### Tenured/Tenure Track Faculty

Tenured and tenure track faculty shall be expected to perform some combination of teaching, research, and service for the Center. The default allocation of effort is 40% Research, 40% Teaching, and 20% Service. Deviations from this allocation, as appropriate, are determined by the Director in consultation with the faculty member (e.g., see Article V). In addition to the annual review process, pre-tenured faculty will also receive a third-year review of their teaching, research, and service activities by a committee appointed by the Director to provide guidance and recommendations to the candidate as they proceed towards tenure. The review is designed to identify potential problems and facilitate a smooth path toward tenure. The procedures for promotion within the Tenure Track ranks are outlined in the VCU Life Sciences Promotion and Tenure Guidelines.

#### Term Faculty

Term faculty are those who are hired to perform teaching and/or research activities in support of the Center’s mission. The effort allocation to term faculty will depend upon the position description and the current workload agreement negotiated between the individual and the Director. In addition to the annual review process, term faculty will also receive a mid-term (e.g., third year) review of their activities by a committee appointed by the Director. The purpose of this review is to provide guidance and recommendations to the candidate as they proceed toward promotion to the next academic rank. The procedures for promotion within the Term Faculty ranks are outlined in the VCU Life Sciences Promotion and Tenure Guidelines.

#### Affiliate Faculty

Affiliate Faculty are individuals who are appointed to a unit outside the Center for Environmental Studies, either in another unit at VCU or from outside the VCU community. They may only be affiliated with the CES for specific research and/or teaching purposes. Affiliate faculty members may attend faculty meetings but they may not vote in Center matters or elections. Policies governing Affiliate Faculty Appointments are provided by the Office of the Provost.

#### Adjunct Faculty

Adjunct Faculty shall be hired by the Director on a temporary, part-time basis to teach specific courses. Adjunct faculty members may attend faculty meetings but they may not vote in Center matters or elections. Adjunct faculty will not receive annual reviews although assessment metrics from their courses will contribute to the overall curriculum assessment of the Center.

## Article III. Center Faculty Meetings

### Section 3.1. Voting Eligibility

All full-time tenured, tenure-track, and term faculty have voting privileges in the unit. Joint-appointment faculty members have the same voting privileges as correspondingly full-time Center faculty, as long as their appointment in the Center exceeds 50% of their effort. Adjunct and affiliate faculty do not have voting privileges. Voting-eligible faculty are expected and encouraged to participate in making recommendations about courses, degree programs, graduate standards, and hiring plans.

### Section 3.2. Voting Mechanisms

Votes shall be cast by a show of hands during a faculty meeting unless the sensitivity of the topic requires the application of a secret ballot, or if specifically requested by a present member. When necessary, electronic poling through email or other means is allowable. Recommendations on all matters of administration and curriculum are decided by a simple majority vote of the faculty. If a majority is not reached after the first vote, there will be a runoff vote between the top two options.

### Section 3.2. Meetings

The Director shall call meetings of the Center faculty and full-time staff as necessary and appropriate. A quorum shall consist of more than 50% of the voting-eligible faculty currently in residence (i.e., not on leave). The following from the VCU Academic Rights and Responsibilities Policy Statement applies:
- The right to develop and recommend – or otherwise, to participate in decisions involving – new degree programs, new course offerings, modifications of existing courses, and degree requirements.
- Participation in setting standards for admission, retention, and graduation of students. The faculty of each School also shall determine which students are eligible for graduation.
- Participation in the formal and informal decision-making processes concerned with educational functions and policies at various administrative levels
- Participation in processes relating to faculty appointments, reappointments, promotions, and tenure

## Article IV. Personnel Policies

### Section 4.1. Promotion and Tenure/Continuing Status Policies

The promotion of faculty in the Center shall follow the [Life Sciences Promotion and Tenure Policy and Guidelines](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14SjWYXc73sfDvfkFbHT25Kb0hZiusdUw/view?usp=sharing).

#### Eligibility

Eligibility for tenure/continuing status and notification is governed by VCU Faculty Promotion and Tenure Policies and Procedures and it is the responsibility of the Director to notify candidates of their eligibility and to summarize the review process during the semester prior to the deadline for submission of materials. Upon appointment, all faculty shall be informed of the CES policies and criteria for retention and relevant promotions and must be reviewed annually and on the probationary schedule outlined below.

#### Evaluation Criteria and Process

Criteria minimally include teaching effectiveness, research excellence, and quality of other creative activities and services to the Center, Life Sciences, University, and Community. Further details on criteria and process can be found in the VCU Faculty Promotion and Tenure Policies and Procedures and the Life Sciences Promotion and Tenure Policy documents.

#### Probationary Reviews

Probationary reviews shall generally occur in the third year of employment as specified by Life Sciences guidelines.

### Section 4.2. Annual Performance Reviews

Following VCU Policy on "Faculty Roles and Rewards" and the VCU Policy on "Annual Assessment of Faculty Performance":

- Faculty roles and rewards must be understood within the context of collective work units, because each unit, whether a large and multifaceted one or a small program, is a key to change and an important unit of productivity. Faculty within each unit must create individualized work plans that are personally meaningful, central to unit life, and consistent with the institutional mission.  
- Faculty must be fairly and accurately evaluated for excellence within the context of their unit. It is required that all faculty be evaluated in writing every year. As part of that evaluation, each faculty member will develop a written work plan, covering at least a year, and will meet individual, unit, and University goals. These plans may utilize a two to three year planning cycle, but with annual review and evaluation of performance.
- Each faculty member's individual work plan will have the written approval of the department chair or other unit head, who is responsible for maintaining an appropriate overall mix of teaching, research, and service for his or her unit.
- The Director will also develop written plans for their work that cover at least a year and that meet the needs of their units and of the University. These plans will be approved in writing by the next higher unit head.

#### Process

The Director will initiate the annual performance review process in accord with Life Sciences Bylaws and follow the guidelines and practices established by CES. Performance-based salary adjustments will be made following the policies and practices of Life Sciences and VCU.

#### Criteria

Criteria for annual reviews as well as those for probationary, promotion, and tenure reviews, minimally include teaching effectiveness, research excellence, and the quality of other creative activities and services to the Center, Life Sciences, University, and Community. Depending on a faculty member’s professional interests and institutional needs, individual faculty work plans may differentiate workload in a particular academic year in accord with VCU policy.

#### Grievances and Appeals

Grievances and appeals shall follow the University’s Faculty Mediation and Grievance Policy, and appropriate Life Sciences Bylaws and guidelines.

### Section 4.3. Post-Tenure Review

The Director shall conduct a post-tenure review of tenured faculty members following the guidelines and practices established by CES and in accordance with Life Sciences, VCU, and BOV policies.

## Section 4.4. Hiring of Faculty and Professional Staff

In all cases, the VCU and Life Sciences Bylaws and policies prevail in the hiring of all faculty and professional staff. General hiring plans for CES will be made by the Director in consultation with the Executive Committee and will be submitted to the Vice Provost of Life Sciences. All searches will follow the policies and practices established by VCU, including the VCU Faculty Search Process Guidelines as provided by the Office of the Provost. For Center staff and faculty, the Director is the Hiring Authority.

## Article V. Teaching Loads

All individuals who have effort allocated to teaching are expected to support the curricular goals of the unit. The amount of teaching for each faculty member will be determined by their teaching effort using the following guidelines. The Director will use Student Contact Hours (SCH which is defined as the # credits for the course multiplied by the number of students) as a metric for determining teaching loads. A baseline of a single 3-credit course with 15 individuals (equal to 45 SCH) per 9-month academic cycle will be used as the benchmark for 10% teaching effort.

The teaching effort for any faculty member may be modified by the Director as follows:
- Scholarly/research activity, as measured primarily by publication record, funding level, and mentoring of graduate students, will be the primary basis for modification of teaching loads. Faculty with higher research activities may be allocated reduced teaching loads whereas those with low research productivity will have heavier teaching.
- The teaching load for faculty with large lecture sections, writing-intensive courses, courses with extensive lab preparations, or in the development of new offerings may also be reduced.
- As necessary, teaching loads may also be adjusted in response to abnormally high service commitments.
- Faculty with joint appointments in other units will be allocated teaching in proportion to their entire effort allocation, not just their teaching allocated to the Center. The Director will negotiate, as necessary, with the other unit to ensure that shared faculty are not negatively impacted by their split appointment.
- Other circumstances/factors, as determined appropriate by the Director, may also be considered for the determination of teaching loads.

## Article VI: Ratification and Amendment of ByLaws

All faculty have the opportunity to provide feedback and considerations for amendments to these bylaws on an annual basis, with a deadline of the first day of the Spring semester as recognized by the VCU calendar. Amendments to these Bylaws may be proposed, in writing, by faculty and staff to either the Director or individuals serving on the Executive Committee for discussion and consideration. These proposed changes will then be considered by the Executive Committee and approved by the Director.  Amendments take effect immediately upon approval.
